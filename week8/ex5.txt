Physical addresses:

they refer to real memory location that are located in the main memory unit, thath they are loaded into the memory address register.
only programs that are to be executed should be put in the physical memory, and sometimes it's not enough for them.
user can't access them, the MMU unit accesses data from these address locations through memory bus


Virtual addresses:

they don't refer to real memory, they are generated by the CPU while running a program that are created to the user , who can access it,
that each user program is assigned to a memory location.
when the physical memory isn't enough to accommodate the running program, CPU generates them to the program during compile time,
these virtual addresses are mapped to the physical addresses during the run time or execution time
